# Electrical Work (Soldering, wiring)

- Since our motors still haven't arrived we found two replacement motors from the lab and soldered new leads to start testing our PID logic

- We have ordered replacement motors, they have arrived and been delivered to the machine shop

- Due to battery drop out on voltage regulators we went with a serial battery setup with one 12V and one 6V battery. The connections from the battery to the emergency stop and start switches have been made

- The SMD components have been soldered on the main board.

- The THT voltage regulators have been soldered on the main board.
