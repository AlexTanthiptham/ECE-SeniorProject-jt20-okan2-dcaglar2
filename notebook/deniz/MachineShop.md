# Machine Shop Progress 

- Had initial meeting with the machine shop where we talked about the possiblity of getting a prebuilt chassis and discussed the division of cost when building the robot

- Visited the machine shop again and picked up a preexisting chassis built for a nother project. Designed CAD to further extend the chassis for our purposes.

- Finalized the design and talked to the machine shop once more to get construction started 

- Waiting on all mechanical parts to arrive to drop everything by the machine shop 

- Talked to the machine shop to get a quote for all construction processes. They quoted 8 hrs/day for 4 days of construction time for our robot.
