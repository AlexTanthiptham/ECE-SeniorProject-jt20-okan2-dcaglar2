# Physical Building Progress

- Had initial meeting with the machine shop where we talked about the possiblity of getting a prebuilt chassis and discussed the division of cost when building the robot

- Visited the machine shop again and picked up a preexisting chassis built for a nother project. Designed CAD to further extend the chassis for our purposes.

- Finalized the design and talked to the machine shop once more to get construction started 

- Waiting on all mechanical parts to arrive to drop everything by the machine shop 

- Talked to the machine shop to get a quote for all construction processes. They quoted 8 hrs/day for 4 days of construction time for our robot.

- The replacement motors arrived and got dropped off at the machine shop

- Picked up the motors from the machine shop, the lower layer of the robot is finished, will add kinect and railings ontop.

- Added our on/off switch to our robot, we chiseled the top wooden layer to create a lower depth then the rest of the surface which was required when mounting our switch. 

- We then drilled some mounting holes on our aluminum lower layer to fasten our main components such as our battery,pcb and breadboard for temporary operations.

- We also employed zip ties and double sided velcro tape to ensure stability for our main components.

- Our next step will be putting on our Xbox Kinect at the front
