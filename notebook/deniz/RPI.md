# RPI Progress

- Initially looked for a bluetooth library to setup on the RPI with Okan

- Gave up on the bluetooth idea since we were able to checkout the Kinect from the lab. 

- Setup OpenCV and libfreenect on the RPI with Python 3.7 with Okan

- Converted our preexisting code to work with libfreenect to read distance and recognize a QR code from our RPI with Okan
