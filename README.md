# ECE445 Final Project

## MCU Code

## Todo
* Transfer Kinect data via UART
* Fix Lidar bug so it doesn't die after one measurement

## Working So Far
* One measurement can be read from the Lidar 
* Motor driver can go forward and back with variable speed
* UART can print
* Can talk to RPi (minimally)

### UART Print Console Instructions

1. Open Putty with the write COM port (For Windows, look at Device Manager).
2. Click Serial and set the baud rate to 115200.
3. It should work!
